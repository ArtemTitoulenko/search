The test plan for the indexer is quite simple. I create a small
series of nested directories, each containing a few text files
and run the program first on the directory, then on one of the
files. After every run, I check the `index_file` that is created
and make sure that the words compare to those in the files that
I created. This ensures that the program is reading all of the
files and that there is consistency.
